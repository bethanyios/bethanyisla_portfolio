<p>
I am a Frontend Engineer with a passion for creating beautiful designs, accessible programming and social impact work.
</p>
<p>
My road to programming began far from the tech world.
</p>
<p>
From a degree in Latin American studies to learning how to program at an intensive bootcamp, I have taken a leap and challenged myself to give me a range of skills.
</p>
<p>
For a year I lived in Colombia, working with youth organisations: one that educated children on environmental sustainability to empower their community, and another that trained young people in orchestral music to guide them away from violence and poverty.
</p>
<p>
Now that I have learnt about the influence of programming, and the vastness of what it we are capable of creating, I canâ€™t wait to be part of making an impact on all levels.
Combining the inventiveness of programming and the creativeness of a team, I am fascinated by the possibilities of what can be produced.
</p>
<p>
I have found something that I gravitate towards even when I'm not working. I love the challenge in learning complex things, and getting immersed in problem solving.
</p>
<p>
With this knowledge in programming I have the autonomy, not only to create powerful and aesthetic products, but to work with a medium I am so compelled by.
